# Simple anime recommendation system

This is a recommendation system for anime titles. It uses the genres of the animes to recommend more titles to the costumer, based on their likings.

The data comes from [Anime Recommendations Database](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You need to download the data (both anime.csv and ratings.csv) and put them in a "Data" folder. Check the link for more information about the dataset and its features.
